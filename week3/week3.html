      <a>As We May Think</a>
      </h3>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Despite being written in 1945, predictions made in the article have come to fruition now,
         76 years later. Since their creation, computers have evolved to the point of being cheap and compact, and are
        widely available everywhere. In the same fashion, predictions that we may have today about technology may fall under the
        same type of evolution and become just as readily available as computers are today. A few types of technology that come to
        mind that may fall under this are VR, AR, and AI technology.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: right;">With the expansion of the internet, many regulations have been put into place 
         in order to regulate the usage of the world wide web. As a result, although the internet has become a staple of human life,
      these regulations can pose risks as ISPs can modulate prices, and in some cases they would be the only ones in an area, forcing
      users to comply to their prices. Additionally, when looking at social media, they exert a huge influence, as in some
      cases they own multiple ie Facebook owning Instagram. This huge influence can be potentially damaging as it limits the market
      and forces users to comply to whichever regulations these private companies decide to put into place.</p>
